/*
 * This file imports the Tailwind CSS utility classes.
 * To make this work, you would typically have a build process (like PostCSS)
 * that processes these directives.
 *
 * For simplicity in our development setup, we will use the Tailwind CDN
 * directly in our HTML, which achieves the same result without a build step.
 * However, this file is good practice to have for a production setup.
 * For now, we can leave it as is, but we will add a script tag to the HTML
 * to ensure our styles are applied.
